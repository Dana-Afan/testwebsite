The library, on the other hand, is extremely secure. To go on this, you must have a library card. If you lose it, you must either try to replicate it or write a letter stating that you have lost it in order to gain access.</p>

                <p>In my opinion, the school is brilliant. The architecture is very pleasant and appealing to the eyes. The events are also quite enjoyable. I had a great time. They also have excellent facilities, such as a gymnasium and an auditorium. However, some of their facilities, such as the Comfort Root, are a little dirty, and some of their ventilation is insufficient, which may cause discomfort to students. But it's fine with me. Overall, it is very good, and you can also learn a lot here at CCC.</p><br>

                <p>The teachers here are very friendly, and I must say that they are very hardworking. Their constant reminders and pep talks will not go unnoticed. They are extremely important to me and the others. They had a well-planned schedule. They do a good job of following it, and I believe they could do better. Although their work is impressive, there is still room for improvement. Excellent work, CCC.</p><br>
