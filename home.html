                <p>I bought the Fujiflm XT-200 about last week and I didn't regret it! So far the best camera I have ever bought. It is very lightweight and it's very compact too! I love the fact that it has a widescreen vari-angle LCD touch screen. The quality of the picture is so so so nice! I love it so much. The Fujifilm XT-200 is a recommended camera for beginners. It is a little bit expensive, but it is worth the price! If you want sample shots, please check my Instagram, @naiiventi_ !!</p><br>

                <p>The best Fujifilm camera that I've tested is the Fujifilm X-T4. It's a great all-around camera with excellent build quality and a rich feature set. It performs well for photography and video alike, ranking among the best mirrorless cameras I've tested. Its APS-C sensor delivers high-quality images with excellent noise handling capability at higher ISO levels, making the camera well-suited to shooting in low light. Its continuous shooting speed is great, so you can easily capture moments of fast-moving action. It delivers remarkable video quality in more controlled lighting conditions, whether shooting in 4k or FHD. While video looks noticeably worse in low light, it's still very good overall. It's less consistent with photography but still performs well overall. Unfortunately, it's not the most comfortable camera to use, especially considering its price point.</p><br>

                <p>My bestfriend bought me a Fujicolor QuickSnap for my birthday! I enjoyed using it, especially with my friends. I adore using vintage films and the QuickSnap is just the perfect camera for that. The camera is also very lightweight so it won't be a hassle to bring it with you everywhere. You just have to be careful when storing it in your bag because it's fragile, I recommend putting it on a case or cover first before storing it inside your bag. Will be using this more in the future, I love it! Thanks Fujifilm!</p><br>

                <p>Fujifilm Philippines sent me the Instax Mini 90 yesterday to review, thank you for this Fujifilm PH! The Instax Mini 90 definitely gives off that "vintage-y" look and vibe, especially the brown-colored one. The design of the camera is very classy and stylish compared to the other versions in the Instax Series. It also has tons of camera modes which is great. This is great for beginners because it is easy to operate. However, the Mini 90 is the smallest of current instant film formats and it doesn't support camera charging. The lighting also has a great impact on the photo's quality. If you are looking for a more detailed and better quality camera, films, and polaroids, I don't suggest buying the Instax Mini 90, it's only great for collecting memories. </p><br>
